# Package-pip-un-install-libraries-for-easy-python
This script, built in Python 3.13.9, offers a simple GUI for installing or uninstalling Python packages using `pip`. Click “install” to run `pip install &lt;package>`, or “uninstall” to run `pip uninstall &lt;package> -y`. A dialog confirms success or shows errors, and buttons stay disabled until a package name is entered.
